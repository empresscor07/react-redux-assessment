//dispatch allows you to dispatch an action to change a state in your application.
//Redux middleware function provides a medium to interact with dispatched
// action before they reach the reducer.
//You can imagine middlewares somewhere between action dispatched and reducer.
// Commonly, middlewares are used to deal with asynchronous actions in your app.
// Redux provides with API called applyMiddleware

//The syntax of using applyMiddleware API is −
const middlewareEnhancer = applyMiddleware(asyncMiddleware, logger) //logger passed here if needed

//A store is an immutable object tree in Redux.
// A store is a state container which holds the application’s state.
// Redux can have only a single store in your application.
// Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer.

//Combines all reducers to allow one root reducer to be sent to the store
const rootReducer = combineReducers({user, events, invites})

//MIDDLEWARE AND REDUCER can be applied to store as follows −
const store = createStore(rootReducer, middlewareEnhancer)
